0 What in Davy Jones’ locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy bilgerat?
1 I’ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and I’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over 300 wenches.
0 I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas.
0 Ye be nothing to me but another source o’ swag.
0 I’ll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true.
0 You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag.
0 As we parley I be contacting my secret network o’ pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil.
0 The kind o’ monsoon that’ll wipe ye off the map.
0 You’re sharkbait, fool.
0 I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o’er seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist.
1 Not only do I be top o’ the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and I’ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o’ the world, ye dog.
0 If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment.
0 But ye couldn’t, ye didn’t, and now ye’ll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon.
1 I’ll shit fury all over ye and ye’ll drown in the depths o’ it.
0 You’re fish food now, lad.
