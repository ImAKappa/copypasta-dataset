0 We’re no strangers to love
0 You know the rules and so do I
0 A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of
0 You wouldn’t get this from any other guy
0 I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling
0 Gotta make you understand
0 Never gonna give you up
0 Never gonna let you down
0 Never gonna run around and desert you
0 Never gonna make you cry
0 Never gonna say goodbye
0 Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
0 We’ve known each other for so long
0 Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it
0 Inside we both know what’s been going on
0 We know the game and we’re gonna play it
0 And if you ask me how I’m feeling
0 Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see
0 Never gonna give you up
0 Never gonna let you down
0 Never gonna run around and desert you
0 Never gonna make you cry
0 Never gonna say goodbye
0 Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
0 Never gonna give you up
0 Never gonna let you down
0 Never gonna run around and desert you
0 Never gonna make you cry
0 Never gonna say goodbye
0 Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
0 (Ooh give you up)
0 (Ooh give you up)
0 (Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give
0 (give you up)
0 (Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give
0 (give you up)
0 We’ve known each other for so long
